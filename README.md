# What is this?
This was meant to be a companion application to a video game. Which one, though, I hadn't thought off in the end so I elected to make one for a game that may or may not exist.

# What is it made of?
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Vue.js.

# Are any of these assets original?
Of course not. I did not manage to leave any comments leading to their actual sources, but most of them hail from the official Monster Hunter Rise site (https://www.monsterhunter.com/rise/us/). Another source of note is Fight Crab (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1213750/Fight_Crab/) and its Fight Crab background (https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/items/1213750/a5ebc016d8665e9d8e342244d46af3611a28524e.jpg).

# How do you start it up?
There's a .bat file I've included in the repo that should do the trick. It's a slapdash answer to a problem that has much better solutions (e.g., Docker), but I was rather pressed for time.

# How long did it take to make?
3 days, on and off.
