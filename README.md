# imaginary-vg-companion-app
This was meant to be a companion application to a video game. Which one, though, I hadn't thought off in the end so I elected to make one for a game that may or may not exist.

# What is it made of?
Vue.js and Firebase.

# How long did it take to make?
3 days, on and off.
