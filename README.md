# What is this?
This was meant to be a companion application to a video game. Which one, though, I hadn't thought off in the end so I elected to make one for a game that may or may not exist.

# What is it made of?
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Vue.js.

# How do you start it up?
There's a .bat file I've included in the repo that should do the trick. It's a slapdash answer to a problem that has much better solutions (e.g., Docker), but I was rather pressed for time.

# How long did it take to make?
3 days, on and off.
